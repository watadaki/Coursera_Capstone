Introduction

Toronto's diversity is reflected in the range of restaurants found within its borders. Countries such as China, India and Spain are 
but a few of the many types of restaurants scattered across the city. 

Problem 

John has just moved to Toronto and would like to open an Indian restaurant close to where he lives. He has noticed that Indian restaurants must compete with 
each other when they are found within proximity to each other. Thus, John must find a nearby neighborhood with as little competition as possible so he can 
open his Indian restaurant successfully.
