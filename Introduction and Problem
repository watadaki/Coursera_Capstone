Introduction

Toronto's diversity is reflected in the range of restaurants found within its borders. Countries such as China, India and Spain are 
but a few of the many types of restaurants scattered across the city. 

Problem 

John has just moved to Toronto and would like to open an Indian restaurant. He has noticed that Indian restaurants must compete with 
each other when they are found within proximity to each other. Thus, he wants to find a neighborhood in Toronto with the least amount
of Indian restaurants to open his own Indian restaurant.
